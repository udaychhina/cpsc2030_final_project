		My Books
	</h2>
	<p>
		I have always been an avid reader and someone who enjoys looking at statistics and data. This was my opportunity to combine both of my hobbies into a project. I have kept a record of all of my books on the Goodreads website but I've been wanting to create one for myself. A website that is minimalistic and aesthetic. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In the future, the vision for this website is to have unique users with their own credentials. A system to follow users and see what they've been reading. I intend to share this wesbite with my friends first and then make it public later.
